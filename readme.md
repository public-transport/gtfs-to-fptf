# gtfs-to-fptf

Convert [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) data to [FPTF](https://github.com/public-transport/friendly-public-transport-format): library and CLI.

*Work in progress. Documentation following soon. [@juliuste](https://github.com/juliuste) will be working on this the next few days, so stay tuned. This software is - by far - not stable yet. The CLI kinda worked already though, at least using data from NRB and DB.*

Things [@juliuste](https://github.com/juliuste) will be working on this week:
- Bugfixes (there's a lot ðŸ˜›)
- Error handling
- Outsourcing the GTFS library
- Writing the docs
- Dependency cleanup
- Tests?
- Eventually publish to npm (hopefully)

Let him know if something else is missing.
